# pi-billion

For all numbers with 'x' digits, what percentage of them are in the first billion digits of pi?

This repo is me attempting to build something that will answer this question in a reasonable amount of time.

## External requirements

This project uses a locally running Postgres server. I'm currently using a Postgres server running in a Docker container.
